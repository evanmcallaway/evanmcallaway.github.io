    <p>Hello!  You've stumbled on my personal website.  Welcome.</p>

    <p>This site has been built in a thoroughly no-frills fashion in homage to the classic sorts of sites folks would hack together for GeoCities, though I've mostly resisted the urge to use marquee tags.</p>

    <p>
      You are probably here to look at some <a href="/dev">example engineering projects</a>.
