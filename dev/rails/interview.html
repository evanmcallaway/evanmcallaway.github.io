      <h3>How I like to interview Rails developers</h3>

      <p>My general principles:</p>
      <ul class="browser-default">
        <li>We aren't here to prove that we're smarter than the interview candidate.</li>
        <li>We don't want to required an "a-ha!" moment during the interview.</li>
        <li>We want to encourage back and forth conversation so that we can get a better understanding of collaborating with the developer.</li>
        <li>This is only a leaping off point.  If something interesting comes up during the interview, pursue it!</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Ruby Warm-up</h4>

      <div class="row">
        <p>What are some things you don't like about Ruby?</p>
        <i>This question is rather open ended, but we should expect an experienced Ruby dev to have some specific feelings about this.</i>
      </div>

      <div class="row">
        <p>Can you explain what unit testing is?  Why put in the effort?  What kinds of cases does it not cover?</p>
        <i>Again, we're starting with broad questions.  Unit tests are intended to varify correctness of an individual unit of code.  A great answer may address unit tests as a contract that guarantees the behavior of our component.  Blindspots may include edge cases in private methods, interactions between unit tested components and also issues with external systems.</i>
      </div>

      <h4>Do You Even Database?</h4>

      <p>For these questions we're going to assume that we're working in an ecommerce system where we have a Users table and an Orders table.</p>

      <div class="row">
        <p>If a user can place multiple orders, what kind of relationships should the two models have?</p>
        <i>Users have_many Orders.  Orders belongs_to users</i>
      </div>

      <div class="row">
        <p>Which table has the foreign key?</p>
        <i>Orders</i>
      </div>

      <div class="row">
        <p>What would be the name of that foreign key?</p>
        <i>user_id</i>
      </div>

      <div class="row">
        <p>If you wanted to fetch a list of orders that do not have an associated user, how would you write that SQL query?</p>
        <i>SELECT * FROM ORDERS WHERE user_id IS NULL</i>
      </div>

      <div class="row">
        <p>If you wanted to fetch a list of user that have not placed any orders, how would you write that query?</p>
        <i>SELECT * FROM users LEFT JOIN orders ON orders.user_id = users.id WHERE orders.id  IS NULL</i>
      </div>

      <h4>Code Refactoring Exercise</h4>

      <p>Reading messy code and cleaning it up is an important part of our jobs.  Let's dive into an example exercise.</p>

      <p>We have some code that tiles an image horizontally and vertically to fill some print width.  This class that returns the coordinates of the upper-left hand corner of the mosaic tiles and whether they would need to be cropped to fit our print width.</p>

      <p>Have the developer share their screen as though you're pair programming and take this functional but ugly code and clean it up for readability and to better follow programming best-practices.</p>

      <pre>
        <code>
# Return x,y coordinates that correspond to the upper-left corners of our tiles
# and a note that indicates if the tile will need to be cropped.
class PrintLayout
  def build(tile_width, tile_height, width, aspect_ratio)
    raise 'bad argument' unless tile_width > 0 and tile_height > 0 and width > 0 and aspect_ratio > 0
    raise 'print too large' if width > 500 or width / aspect_ratio > 500

    result = []

    i = 0
    j = 0
    while i * tile_width < width + 1 do
      while j * tile_height < width / aspect_ratio + 1 do
        if i * tile_width + tile_width > width + 1 or j * tile_height + tile_height > width / aspect_ratio + 1
          result = result + [[[i * tile_width, j * tile_height], 'CROP']]
        else
          result = result + [[[i * tile_width, j * tile_height], 'FULL']]
        end
        j = j + 1
      end
      j = 0
      i = i + 1
    end

    result_hash = {}
    result.each do |coord, status|
      result_hash[coord] = status
    end
    return result_hash
  rescue Exception
    return {}
  end
end

pp PrintLayout.new.build(20, 30, 50, 0.5)
        </code>
      </pre>

      <p>There's a lot of ways to approach this exercise, especially given the limited time constraints of an interview.  Some areas I like to see targetted:</p>
      <ul class="browser-default">
        <li>Add a dummy test that verifies the output so that we don't need to visually verify that the output is unchanged.</li>
        <li>Pull object initialization out into an initialize method.</li>
        <li>Remove exception-driven argument checking -- it masks other exceptions as we work.</li>
        <li>Split up our one giant method into functional units.</li>
        <li>Fix the "manual" iteration in the while loops to be more idiomatically Ruby.</li>
        <li>Reduce duplicated logic around adding tiles.</li>
      </ul>

      <p></p>

      <p>Here's an example result -- expect variation here!  For example, you may prefer to keep some of helper methods that are only called in a single spot in-line.</p>

      <pre>
        <code>
# Return x,y coordinates that correspond to the upper-left corners of our tiles
# and a note that indicates if the tile will need to be cropped.
class PrintLayout
  MAX_SIZE = 500

  attr_reader :tile_width, :tile_height, :width, :height, :aspect_ratio

  def initialize(tile_width, tile_height, width, aspect_ratio)
    @tile_width = tile_width
    @tile_height = tile_height
    @width = width
    @aspect_ratio = aspect_ratio
  end

  def build
    return {} unless valid_layout?

    {}.tap do |result|
      (0...horizontal_tiles).each do |i|
        (0...vertical_tiles).each do |j|
          add_tile(result, i, j)
        end
      end
    end
  end

  private

  def valid_layout?
    [tile_width, tile_height, width, aspect_ratio].all?(&:positive?) &&
      (width < MAX_SIZE || height < MAX_SIZE)
  end

  def height
    @height ||= width / aspect_ratio
  end

  def horizontal_tiles
    @horizontal_tiles ||= (width.to_f / tile_width).ceil
  end

  def vertical_tiles
    @vertical_tiles ||= (height.to_f / tile_height).ceil
  end

  def add_tile(result, i, j)
    tile_x = i * tile_width
    tile_y = j * tile_height
    result[[tile_x, tile_y]] = tile_fits?(tile_x, tile_y) ? 'CROP' : 'FULL'
  end

  def tile_fits?(tile_x, tile_y)
    tile_x + tile_width > width || tile_y + tile_height > height
  end
end

layout =  PrintLayout.new(20, 30, 50, 0.5).build
