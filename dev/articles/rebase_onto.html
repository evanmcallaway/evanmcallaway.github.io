      <h3>You should use <code>git rebase --onto</code></h3>

      <h4>What's it for?</h4>
      <p>
        At its core a rebase onto operation is used for moving commits from a specific parent commit to a new specific parent commit.
      </p>
      <p>Typical situations this may be useful include:</p>
      <ul class="browser-default">
        <li>Your branch is based off another branch that has been merged.</li>
        <li>Your branch is based off another branch that has been squashed.</li>
        <li>Your branch is based off another branch that has been deleted.</li>
        <li>Your branch is based off a branch that is unrelated to your branch's work.</li>
        <li>You created a branch on the wrong base and would like to move it onto a different base branch.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Usage</h4>
      <code>git rebase --onto newbase oldbase</code>
      <p>Note that the newbase and oldbase arguments are reversed from a typical "source -> destination" argument order.</p>
      <p>If you currently have a remote branch, you will need to force push your changes onto it after running this command.</p>

      <h4>Examples</h4>
      <p>To move your branch's base to be master from oldbranch.</p>
      <code>git rebase --onto origin/master oldbranch</code>

      <p>To move your branch's base to be master from af893ea (where af893ea is the commit just before your work).</p>
      <code>git rebase --onto origin/master af893ea</code>

      <p>To move your branch's base to be the commit eb3a99f from af893ea (where af893ea is the commit just before your work).</p>
      <code>git rebase --onto eb3a99f af893ea</code>

      <p>After resolving any conflicts, force push your changes to your remote branch if it exists.</p>
