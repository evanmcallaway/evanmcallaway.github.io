        <h3>This Kinda Dumb Webite</h3>
        <p>
            In the modern era it's easy to shackle ourselves to our tools.  We've somehow convinced ourselves that to build a website you need a backend server, a frontend framework, dockerized environments, deploy scripts, etc, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
            While this is largely true if you want to do anything beyond the bare minimum, I thought it would be a good exercise to go back to basics and build a simple portfolio website using the most basic tools available: HTML, JS, and CSS...just like our cavemen ancestors used to use while hunting wild goats in the wilderness that was GeoCities. It's an overly simplistic approach and it's not without its downsides -- you've often got to be creative if you'd like to avoid a lot of duplication.
        </p>
        <p>
            A simplistic way to avoid this duplication is to create a simple loading script that sandwiches layout content around your page content.
        </p>
        <pre>
            <code>
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function() {
    fetch(`/layout/header.html`).then(file => {
        file.text().then(content => {
            document.body.insertAdjacentHTML('afterbegin', content)
        })
    })

    fetch(`/layout/footer.html`).then(file => {
        file.text().then(content => {
            document.body.insertAdjacentHTML('beforeend', content)
        })
    })
})
            </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
            ...and then just include the script in each file where you want your layout.  Super simple.  Absolutely not how you'd do it for anything other than a pet project.  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
        </p>
